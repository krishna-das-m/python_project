Students in primary school often arrange arithmetic problems vertically to make them easier to solve. For example, "235 + 52" becomes:
```
  235
+  52
-----
```
Finish the arithmetic_arranger function that receives a list of strings which are arithmetic problems, and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to True, the answers should be displayed.
### For example

Function Call:
```py
arithmetic_arranger(["32 + 698", "3801 - 2", "45 + 43", "123 + 49"])
```

Output:
```
   32      3801      45      123
+ 698    -    2    + 43    +  49
-----    ------    ----    -----
```
